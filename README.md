## Description üìë

This is an application that shows superheroes cards with information about them and their pictures. The user can edit these cards, delete them, create new ones and search for a superhero in this list.

## The site is live at 
https://analauraarce.github.io/heroesApp/

The live version does not allow editing the database, so some application options will not work such as editing or deleting a superhero.
To test this application locally, download the database (db.json) from https://github.com/analauraarce/heroes-server and run        
`json-server --watch db.json`.

To use lazy loading, Angular Material, JSON Server, Angular Flex, Flexbox, CRUD, route protection: Guards, canActivate, canLoad and others that were used to build this application.

## HeroesApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
